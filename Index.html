        <h2>Addendum</h2>
        <h3>Process:</h3>
        <p>I preferred CSS class manipulation rather than using inline styles to ma
            nipulate the states of squares using JavaScript. This separation of concerns, relat
            ing to logic and design, facilitated better code clarity.</p>
        <p>Creating a random board that would be solvable. Rather than using automa
            ted positioning, I chose to use click placebo to swap individual blocks and their n
            eighbors so that the board formed at the start of the game was solvable and easy fo
            r the user.</p>
        <h3>Creative Choices:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Game Board Design:</strong> Used CSS Grid for flexible squa
                re alignment, scalable to any size.</li>
            <li><strong>Aesthetic Choices:</strong> Chose a pink–purple–neutral gra
                dient to make it as comfy as possible.</li>
            <li><strong>Metallic Shine:</strong> Improved gradient animation with a
                soft, sophisticated shine.</li>
            <li><strong>Title Animation:</strong> Used pulse effect and text-shadow
                to add depth and emphasis.</li>
            <li>Developed glowing squares and hover effects for better engagement o
                n the site.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Challenges and Solutions:</h3>
        <p>Installed an actual shuffle algorithm by commenting out squares that wou
            ld lead to a solvable state, instead of setting them over Board.load() using the si
            mulateClicks() method.</p>
        <p>Split functionality and design by using JavaScript for game logic and CS
            S for styling, making it easier to add new features or changes in the future.</p>
        <h3>Insights Gained:</h3>
        <p>Understood that it’s better to divide the project into significant segme
            nts or modules so that modifications to the game’s rules or design don’t impact oth
            ers.</p>
        <p>Learned how to emulate clicks to make functionality work without excessi
            ve logical complexity.</p>
        <h3>Serving the Font:</h3>
        <p>I applied the NeonLights font for the title, SuperShiny for the addendum
            headings, and Marbley font for the addendum text. I used the <code>@font-face</code> process to serve the
            fonts, uploaded the font files to the server to ensure they
            load correctly on all devices.</p>
